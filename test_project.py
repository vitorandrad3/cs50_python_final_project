comments= ['It\'s honestly absurd how good the "Spider-Verse" movies are. "Across the Spider-Verse"\nis just as great, if not better than "Into the Spider-Verse". I really don\'t know how.\n"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt\ncharacter beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter\neggs. Loved how Gwen\'s story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham\'s Captain\nStacy are truly special.', "I went out to the theaters to see Spider Man into the spider verse too. And there's one\nthing I didn't know about it that perhaps if I had known about it in the beginning, I would\nhave been able to judge it less harshly and enjoy it more. Spider verse two is part two of\nwhat they now are going to call the spider verse trilogy. That is to say it's a lot more like\nEmpire Strikes Back is the first part of a two part movie. So I really don't know that I can\nreview it that well, or say too much about it and the plot and the story, but when I can\nsay is the into the spider verse to like spider verse one is incredibly beautiful. Each of the\nworld has their own graphic art style, which is lovingly applied by the animators\nreminding us that there can be movies in more than just generic Disney Animation, or\ngeneric Pixar Animation, that there are many options when it comes to animation and\nthey're all about the same price. Although some of these do use expensive computer\nanimation to make it look like paper or our oil painting, or animated pencil animation.\nThe film is full of fun references to other Spider Man films, Spider Man comic strips and\neven internet Spider Man rumors about Donald Glover becoming Miles Morales. The plot\nhums along and it's slowly develops who the main villain would be. At first it's hard to\ntell. It also develops the relationship between Spider Gwen and the main character. Not\nmy littles blouse, the other Spider Man. Anyway, there's a lot of spider man and there's a\nlot of spider man in this film. I wish there would have been more spider pig and his\nexcellent humor. I'm curious to see where the series goes in the third installment, which I\nassume will unite perfectly with the second film like Empire with Return of the Jedi. And\nat that time, perhaps I'll be able to better understand if it was great or not. But yes, it\nmakes a big difference knowing that it's part two of three and that there will be no\nending giant cliffhanger. Until next time", "Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film\nsurpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I\nstarted wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were\ndragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and\nhis child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how\nlong certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I\nunderstood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next\nfilm and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which\nis fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth\nseeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.", "Iwas a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw\nmassive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well,\nthat couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from\nthe beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film\npicked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out,\nwatching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the\nend of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits\nbegan rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive\ndialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think\nthe wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of\nmaking the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation,\nsoundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the\nbest animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness\nof it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!", "I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they\nmade it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion\nit's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.\n\nVisually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are\nwatching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it\nfeel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and\nso many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get\ngood they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie\nsuch a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film\nis not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.", "The animation was fine, but nothing else. Is this movie really a 9.0 at the moment? The\nplot was completely flawed and all around head by bad example and messaging, which\nI'm sure most Marvel fans won't understand. None of the characters were likable; this\ncocky, smartass, trying-to-crack-some-kinda-joke ALL THE TIME is down right annoying\nand, let's face it, unrealistic. This is why kids act as if they are something they're not.\nThere's a part two this this film, but honestly I have no desire to see the next one. WAY\nTOO LONG. TOO DRAGGED ON. AND IN NO WAY NEXT LEVEL ANYMORE. They had a good\nride with the first one, but now these are just a massive pile of trash.", "This movie probably deserves an 8, better than the last, but it simply does not deserve to\nbe at the number 12 spot on the 250. There is no way classic movies that deserve to be\nup there should be below this movie. In my opinion it is still not even the best spider-\nman movie. Very good voice acting, and incredibly animation but the story does not\njustify this much acclaim. Also this movie is a part one of two. The story has no\nconclusion yet it's considered one of the best movies even though it's missing a crucial\nelement in storytelling. All I am saying is that this movie is good, but it being Godfather\nlevel is not justified.", "The movie was amazing with lots of action and adventure. They have cool characters like\nspot who can teleport across the multi-spider verse. The movie's soundtrack is brilliant\nand beautiful. But it might be scary for children that are 0-5 years old . It has violent\nscenes and sad moments. There is a universe which is spider-verse but it isn't the real\nname for the universe. There is a Spider-Man team that tries to protect the multiverse .\nIt also talked about relationships between parents and children. It's about love,\nfriendship and family. I would definitely look forward the next episode. Great work,", 'Saw the 9.0 here and was super excited to see this film. Very disappointing! Plot moves\nat light speed, and continues to jump around the whole film. Scenes flash every 2\nseconds and it was exhausting to follow. Animation is excellent, but this movie lacked the\nhook that made the first one so good. Maybe this is where movies are now headed, but I\nhope not. For a show aimed toward a younger audience, the film was way too long at 2\nhours and 20 minutes and seemed to hold the audience hostage. Very hard to keep track\nof all the characters and plot shifts. Was hoping for something better but it seemed like a\ncomic book on speed.', "As a fan of Spiderman, I really enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse because it has\nthe best plot supported by amazing visual effects which make this movie a godsend, a\nmasterpiece. While watching this movie, I don't even realise it is a 2 hours 16 mins\nmovie."]
